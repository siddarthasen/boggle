I created my own verson of 'Boggle', a 2 player game where the players have to find words in a square board of letter. The player with the most words wins. 

Players can choose what size board they want. My program is able to find words using a DFS algorithm. Additionally, my program checks for duplicate or unreal words, so players do not get awarded unfair points. 

The whole project was for my CS10 class at UC Berkeley. Enjoy my game :-)
